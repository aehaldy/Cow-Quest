# Cow-Quest

I created this short and sweet adventure/puzzle game in Godot Engine as a fun way to make some blocks of reusable code for future games, such as player movement control, contrl of NPC movement, cut scene mechanisms, and an inventory system.

This repo does not include the music or SFX files, because I do not have copyright permission to share them. Many graphical assets were remixed from Enterbrain's RPG Maker VX, of which I own a licensed copy. Please do not redistribute assets from this repo without permission. This was purely a learning exercise and and not indented for publication of any kind.
